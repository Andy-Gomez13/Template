# Hello! Thank you for viewing my repository! 
#In this repository I was tasked with finding a data set and creating a data visual for the data. The data used was data regarding an English Premier League team - Arsenal and there positions in the last couple of years. In the exercise I cleaned and prepped the data to get it ready to graph. The resulting graph is my work in showing Arsenal's table position in each year since 1992/93. 
#Below is the image of the graph I created.
